              Beyond coding, I have a strong background in design, utilizing tools like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe
              Illustrator, and Figma to bring creative ideas to life. My goal is to bridge the gap between design and
              development, creating seamless user experiences that are both functional and beautiful.
